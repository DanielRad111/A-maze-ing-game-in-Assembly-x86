# A-maze-ing-game-in-Assembly-x86
This is the source code for the A-maze-ing game in Assembly x86 for the 1st semester at Technical University Of Cluj-Napoca CS Department
The maze is perfectly done, except for a few things. If you are facing the walls from a specific direction, you will pass through the walls. You can try to fix this but it will take a while. Also try and change the design a little bit for your own good :)
